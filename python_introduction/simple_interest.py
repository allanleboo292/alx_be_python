# Defining the variables
principal = 1000  # Principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05       # Annual interest rate as a decimal (5%)
time = 3          # Time in years

# Calculating simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Printing the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
